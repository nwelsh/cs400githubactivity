Once upon a time there was a very large dragon. His name was Archie. Normal dragons usually fight knights, raid villages, and breathe fire. Archie had no interest in these things, however. What he wanted to do, was to dance. However, Archie's father wouldn't let him. So he devised a plan to dance in secret... 

Aryaman: Archie was assigned to destroy 2 big islands by his father. When he flew there, he found a big cave. Instead of levelling the 2 islands with his breathe, he would dance in that big cave. One day, Archie's father decided to visit his son to see how he is doing. As he was approaching the islands, he was left perplexed by how there were no signs of destruction...


Nicole: Archie was dancing with all his new island friends. His father was furious at first but then he saw how happy archie was. Archie surprised his dad with his dancing abilities and his father was so happy to see his son dancing. Arcie and his father danced for hours and they both moved to the islands and became good dragons.
